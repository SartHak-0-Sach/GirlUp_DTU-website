- Serves as a **resource hub** for interested individuals to get involved and contribute.

### Features

- **Mission & Vision:** Information about the goals and objectives of the GirlUp movement at DTU.
- **Get Involved:** A section to encourage students to join the initiative or contribute to ongoing campaigns.
